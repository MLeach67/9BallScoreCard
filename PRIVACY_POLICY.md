9 Ball Score Card: Privacy policy

Welcome to the 9 Ball Score Card for Android.

This Android app developed by Marshall Leach. The source code is available on GitHub.

Data collected by the app

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme) and alarms) created by the you (the user) is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.
evice restarts, all alarms set in the system are lost. This permission enables the app to receive a message from the system once the system has rebooted and you have unlocked your device the first time. When this message is received, the app creates a service to set all the active alarms in the system.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Marshall Leach
